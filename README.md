# Futuregenerators

This mod was commissioned by `clown_95x`. It is for Minecraft 1.20, on Forge.

It adds a few different blocks :

- Boiler. Pipe in water and give it fuel, out comes hot water.
- Water turbine. Pipe in hot water, out comes power. Spins up to produce more power with continuous use.
- Washer. Pipe in hot water, cobblestone and power, out comes resources.
- Lightning generator. Sits below a lightning rod and consumed power + lightning "charges" to run neighbouring dynamos.
- Lightning dynamo. These can be placed surrounding the lightning generator, and will produce power when generators it touches are running.
